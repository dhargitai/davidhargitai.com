              Basically, I'm a positive and cheerful person. How could I be anything else, as I'm healthy and surrounded by loving, fantastic family and friends. I'm thankful for them every day!
              <br />
              Also, as everyone else, I've also lived some harder times too, but now I can be grateful for those for helping me to become the person I am today.
