Two days ago a kind and nice man almost went through me with his Mercedes when I walked across the crosswalk. (by our rules he should have stopped there)

He barely slowed down and when I looked at him (alarmed) he heavily waved with his hand that I should move faster. So I slowed down a bit and raised my hands as someone who accepts a challenge...

I don't know why I did it, I got angry immediately.

And after I went through the crosswalk he pulled over, pulled down the window and started to yell at me (above his woman) that I should walk slowly in the downtown, not on the crosswalk.

So I yelled back that I walk across as slowly as I want, and got ready for some fight if he wants. But he angrily drove away, and I felt some tension in my guts for about an hour or two afterwards.

Was this the best course of action that he could do, weaving and yelling at someone who made him slow down? I don't think so.

Should I have reacted this way? Maybe not, even if I was right.

So no matter how we logically know how we should behave, in a lot of times it's completely irrelevant to what we actually do.

## What's the point?

We are emotional beings. We decide based on our emotions, and just justify them with logic later (if we can).

So when you write, you want to select one or two of the basic human emotions which you will use to present your offer or your point.

What are these?

Alan S. Cowen and Dacher Keltner, PhD from the University of California published a study which identifies 27 different emotion categories.

I list them here in alphabetical order, extended with some others and mark the most important ones for you:

- Admiration
- Adoration
- Aesthetic Appreciation
- Amusement
- ** Anger **
- Anxiety
- ** Aspiration **
- Awe
- Awkwardness
- Boredom
- Calmness
- Confusion
- Craving
- ** Curiosity **
- Disgust
- Empathetic pain
- Entrancement
- ** Envy **
- Excitement
- ** Fear **
- ** Greed **
- ** Hope **
- Horror
- Interest
- Joy
- ** Nostalgia **
- ** Romance **
- Sadness
- Satisfaction
- Sexual desire
- ** Shame **
- Sympathy
- Triumph

Now you can select one or two and think about the aspects of your offer, stories and facts that could be related to that selected emotions. Or just can be seen, perceived in that light.

Let me show you an example.

> My parents divorced when I was 6, and we moved away from my father when I was 10.

Here's how I could tell you this story in different ways by focusing on different emotions...

### Hope:

My mother finally broke the poisoning relationship with my father and started a new life, helping us find peace and a way to build up our lives.

### Shame:

That time I felt that I was the main reason of all the conflicts and fights between them. My father wasn't the best himself at that time and had alcohol problems, so I also wasn't too proud that he's my father.

### Fear:

I was terrified when he broke down the door on us on a night when he was drunk. I can't remember all the details clearly, only the horror that I felt, and my mother told me later that I was just shaking in the bad and crying and shout to him loudly to stop already.

Same story, different aspects and moments to communicate different kind of emotions.

So, as you see, editing is everything.

Just like in movies. They say that the movie is made in the editing room, not on recording the scenes.

_See this in action:_

For an awesome demonstration of this, check out a video on YouTube about how different the end result can be if you choose different parts of the movie for the trailer.

Google "_Harry Potter in different genres_" or something like that, and you'll find it.

Another example:

> 680,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses in 2020.

### Fear based representation:

We're all doomed.

### Hope based representation:

1999 death toll: 2.8 million
