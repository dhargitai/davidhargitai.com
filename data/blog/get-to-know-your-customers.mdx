Have you ever struggled what to write for your market to get their attention and sell your products/services? I bet you have. According to the world's best copywriters the #1 reason for this is...

...that you don't know your market and your customers enough. Today I'll show you some tips how to get to know them better.

How?

By using the fantastic tools of the internet. Let's get started...

## How to know your customers and market better

The main goal is to collect as much information about your target customers as humanly possible. Why?

Because when you've made an extensive research, then the main problem what you'll have at content creation won't be what to write, but what to leave out...

You'll be flooded with awesome ideas. Just need to pick something and you'll good to go with a new content piece.

The main things to find out about your ideal customer are:

_**Who is this person?**_

Answer this in a broad way. I mean mostly psychographically, not demographically.

Everyone tell you about to find out how old are they, what's their income and educational level and stuff like that. I'm not telling about this.

Let me show you what I mean.

## Your compass to know all the important things about your customers

I'll guide you with some basic questions that you'd need to answer when you're doing your research online:

- What keeps them awake at night?
- What causes them pain?
- Who are they blaming for their problems?
- What makes them angry?
- Who exactly are they angry at?
- What do they worry about most?
- What are the top things they are terrified of?
- What are their values like?
- What religion are they?
- What are their most burning problem right now?
- Who are their enemies?
- What are their political views?
- What things are frustrate them the most each day?
- What do they want to get/achieve more than anything?
- Who is the decision maker in their family?
- Why should they use your product?
- How do they feel themselves when they make a search for a solution to their problem, that's related to your offer?
- What kind of words/slang do they use in their everyday life?
- What books/magazines are they reading?
- What movies are they watching?
- What do they do for fun?
- What other related products are they buying?
- Where do they hang out online? Forums, chat sites?

This is not the full list from my research process, but enough for you to get the idea.

Now let's see some methods where you can find the answers to these questions.

## Research methods, aka how to answer these questions

### 1) If you have existing customers, talk to them.

Incentivize them with some of your products or by giving them your time.

### 2) Googling/clicking around

Make a search for "best [niche] blogs" and start checking them, follow the links, if you find something interesting, read it. Soak up everything.

Extra tip: check out the industry rankings on Detailed.com for the list of the best blogs in your niche.

### 3) Take a look at your competitors offerings

What offers do they have? What pain points do they highlight? What words do they use to communicate their offers with the market?

Make sure to check only those competitors who are selling a lot, because probably they've done their research right.

### 4) Search through Amazon among related books

Check the best selling books. See their table of contents and the reviews. What words and phrases they use? What are the reviewers complaining about?

Pro tip: check for Best Sellers Rank. If it's under 100,000, that book sells a lot.

### 5) Search on Youtube

This is the 2nd biggest search engine in the worlds. Search for related videos to your niche. You can see how old a video is and how much views it got since it was uploaded.

Check the most viewed videos and take a note of its title. Read the comments. People love to comment on videos, there's a chance here you will find the most of the golden nuggets.

### 6) Lurk at their online communities: forums, chat sites, FB groups, sub reddits

Be the fly on the wall. It's so painfully easy and yet so effective. People often talk about their deepest fears and problems at these places.

Once you've done with all the above, two things will happen:

1. a lot of hours flew over you
2. you collected an enourmous amount of information about your market and target customer that you can use to make better offers and better sales messages for them
