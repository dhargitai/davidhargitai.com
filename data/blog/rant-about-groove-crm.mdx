Today I'll talk about what I don't like about the Groove Suite.

> (What is it, you ask? It's a whole software package to replace your autoresponder, sales funnel and website builder, cart software etc. More on that later.)

First,  
it is developed pretty slowly. At least it feels so, after I bought it.

Maybe this is just a perception, and it's not that bad, I don't know. I joined around April and at the time of this writing the autoresponder is still not available to me, because of the preparations.

Second,  
it changes a lot. E.g. the Groove Pages software, despite it's a great page builder, its user interface is a lot different that it was when I first saw it.

This makes it quite frustrating to learn how it works. You have to relearn big parts of it every couple of months.

Third,  
it's extremely hard to get a good grasp on what's where, where should you start and how to become good at using it fast.

Most of the time the community recommends David Lemon's Imperfect Action Challenge to watch on YouTube. And oh man! That's a pain.

I mean, he's teaching good stuff, but he talks so much so that even the freshest newbie on the internet can easily understand what's going on.

And I'm not considering myself a newbie, so it's painfully slow for me.

Other thing:  
they let other businesses to name their product similar to theirs.

For example there's a `GrooveCopy` named copywriting software which has a JV promotion for Groove CRM users. Not the same product, but with similar names.

The result?

The low-culture users are always complaining that they aren't providing for free what they promised on the sales page and how dare they have not finished everything for now and so on and so forth.

I have two problems with these dumbasses:

1. If they would have read the sales page from start to finish, they would know that everything they promised are already there.

> Ok, not GrooveMail (autoresponder), as some other dumbasses used it to spread their spam everywhere when it was opening to the wide market, and now they are in a recovery/IP warm up phase.

> It's a slow process indeed, but I can understand that they want the best for all their customers.

2. Even one simple software's development time can be anywhere from 6 months to whatever years. And in the Groove CRM there already are 9 (!) great quality softwares like funnel builder, cart software, autoresponder, website builder etc.

So as a software engineer I can understand why the other 8 or so promised software aren't available yet.

They want to make the already available ones to be great. But there are always people who are complaining about this...

And the last point:

the internet is already full of

"_Brutally Honest Review_" and  
"_Is Groove Funnels a scam?_" and  
"_Groove Funnels vs. ClickFunnels, which are the best choice?_"

types of bullshit blog posts.

Why?

Of course because of their pretty neat affiliate program.

When you had a chance you could buy it for a one-time fee for life, and then they pay you two tier affiliate commissions (up to 40%), which was more than $500 if someone bought the premium package through your link.

Not bad, I have to admit.

I guess when you read this the one-time offer isn't available anymore, only the monthly packages. (Let's see it for yourself though.)

But no worries, the affiliate offer is also available for the monthly paying users as well, so it's still a good opportunity to make some money. Even when someone become a monthly user through your link, which means recurring affiliate commission for you!

**Let me be clear about something:**

I know that it's still in beta phase. They're constantly developing the software, so I can be grateful. Ok, I know.  
But I needed to write these out from me.
