summary: "Forever young, I want to be forever young... so one day maybe I'll get my letter from the postman"
---

More than 2 weeks ago I sent a postal letter to my sister who lives in another country, but still in Europe.

There was a small attachment inside the envelope which would be really important for my her, so I sent it as a registered, priority letter.

And she still hasn't heard about it... Priority, registered letter, sent 2 weeks ago.

In the last half a year they even lost two of my letters which contained my new debit card from my bank...

The postal services are so terrible in both of our countries that soon we will need to send everything via couriers.

But what does this all do with your relationships, you ask?

Now imagine that you have an email list with all your existing clients, and you want to say something important for them, so they will buy from you or just trust/like you more.

If you send them emails only weekly / fortnightly / monthly, it's the exact same as you would send your letters to your loved one via our horrible postal services...

They want to hear from you... they're thinking about you... and nothing. And slowly your connection gets colder and colder, and soon they don't think about you so much as before.

And one you become a person who pops into their minds only when they get your slowly delivered letter.

That's why you should consider sending daily emails to your list.

Because this way you can build a tribe of fans who like you, think of you and want to hear from you.

That why this is my favorite method to communicate with my fellow people too. If you'd like me to help you with your daily emails, you can book a 15m discovery chat with me here: davidhargitai.com/discovery-call
